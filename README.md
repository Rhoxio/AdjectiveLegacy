# Adjective Legacy (Phase 2 Project from Dev Bootcamp)
### Main files for my portfolio challenge during Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp.

This project was born in an intense time of my life. Much of the code here is a byproduct of me realizing how functionality worked more than how to use it in a correct and efficient manner. I was primarily concerned with figuring out exactly how to get AJAX to work and ended up using quite a lot of it.

The code is mostly commented, but it has been commented by a less experienced version of myself about a year in the past.

It is nice to go back and see how much you have grown and I have kept the code as vanilla as possible. You can see marked growth over the build process as concepts and a rapid cycle of self-learning eventually took over me and helped me produce this as it is now. The while build took about 50 hours of work at the time and heavily influenced my success with the rest of Dev Bootcamp's immersive.

If you are a beginner looking at this, please note that much of this code is perfectly fine and functional, but is in no way the cleanest version of itself. There are times when hashes are more acceptable to use than arrays and tims where I didn't realize that I had to parse JSON over to a JS object. Beginner stuff.

If you are an established coder, this is a look in to what was understood with about two months of programming knowledge packed in to two weeks of work. It was a valiant first attempt, and most things work at least decently OK. Have fun reading the code!
