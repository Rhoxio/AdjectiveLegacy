This project is being converted over to a simple j-rpg style game creation engine. During it's creation, I came to the realization that a ton of the code that I was using to generate enemies, characters, and update elemnts of the UI were all extremely dynamic and could be repurposed to either make a full-fledged game, or be fine-tuned to make a simple game creation engine. 

My goal at this point is to accomplish both. I wish to make a game with the tool that I am developing as a sort of 'mock' trial and a basic testing suite. Drafts and versions of the engine will be released as I have have time to work on them.

# Technologies

I am planning on making the API for the engine from a simple Sinatra app that uses Postgresql as a database. I decided that I need to use a relational database because quite frankly, it will make the development process run more smoothy if I don't have to mess around with non-relational data. It would overcomplicate simple tasks.

As for the front-end, I am doing all of it in Javascript. I am thinking that Angular will serve me well for this prject, but I am dreading the day that it becomes obsolete. Maybe I will write it in Coffeescript insead and just compile? I will think about this a little bit more, and considering I haven't touched Coffeescript before, I will need to try it out and see if it is a viable solution for the problem at hand.
